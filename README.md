# akash-guard

A standalone provider add-on for [Akash Network](https://akash.network) that detects and alerts on abusive tenant workloads — DDoS tools, spam bots, port scanners, and connections to known malicious infrastructure.

Akash is a permissionless marketplace. Providers bear the consequences of abusive deployments: IP reputation damage, ISP blacklisting, uplink saturation, and potential legal exposure. `akash-guard` gives providers visibility and alerting without interfering with the decentralized, permissionless nature of the network. It never automatically kills a lease.

**Image**: `shimpa/akash-guard:latest` (Docker Hub)

## How It Works

`akash-guard` runs as a Kubernetes DaemonSet on every provider node and operates two independent detection engines:

### Component 1 — Threat Intel Blocker

Periodically fetches IP blocklists from public threat intelligence feeds, then creates a Calico `GlobalNetworkPolicy` that **logs and denies** egress to those IPs. Any policy hit produces an alert with full context: namespace, destination IP, and the feed that flagged it.

Feeds used by default:
- [Abuse.ch Feodo Tracker](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/) — botnet C2 servers
- [Spamhaus DROP](https://www.spamhaus.org/drop/) — hijacked/rogue netblocks
- [Spamhaus EDROP](https://www.spamhaus.org/drop/) — extended DROP list

### Component 2 — Anomaly Detector

Attaches an eBPF TC (traffic control) egress hook to every pod veth interface on the host. Over each configurable time window it tracks per-namespace:

| Signal | What it detects |
|---|---|
| Packets per second (PPS) | Volumetric flood / DDoS |
| Unique destination IP count | Scatter-shot DDoS, scanning |
| Outbound connections to port 25 | Spam bots |
| SYN packet rate | SYN flood, port scanning |

When any threshold is breached the event is logged and all configured alert channels are notified. No traffic is blocked and no leases are terminated.

### Alerting Channels

All channels fire simultaneously on every detection event:

| Channel | Details |
|---|---|
| Structured JSON log | Always on — written to stdout, compatible with any log aggregator |
| Prometheus metrics | `akash_guard_alerts_total` counter, labelled by type and namespace |
| Webhook | HTTP POST of a JSON event payload to a configurable URL |
| Email | SMTP delivery with JSON body |

## Prerequisites

### Provider nodes
- Kubernetes with **Calico** as the CNI
- Linux kernel ≥ 6.6 (TCX attachment); ring buffer requires ≥ 5.8
- `CAP_BPF`, `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, `CAP_PERFMON`, `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE` available to the DaemonSet pod

### Development machine (any OS)
- Go ≥ 1.26
- SSH access to a Linux build VM
- `rsync`

### Linux build VM (for eBPF code generation and Docker builds)
- `clang` and `llvm`
- `libbpf-dev`
- `gcc-multilib` (provides `asm/types.h` required by the eBPF C compiler)
- `linux-headers-amd64`
- Go ≥ 1.26
- Docker

Install on Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
apt-get install -y clang llvm libbpf-dev gcc-multilib linux-headers-amd64
# Install Go from https://go.dev/dl/ — do not use the distro package, it is too old
```

---

## Quick Deploy (pre-built image)

The fastest path to a running instance:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shimpa1/akash-guard/main/deploy/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shimpa1/akash-guard/main/deploy/configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shimpa1/akash-guard/main/deploy/daemonset.yaml
```

Verify:
```bash
kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l app=akash-guard
kubectl -n kube-system logs -l app=akash-guard
```

On a healthy deployment you should see within ~10 seconds:
```json
{"level":"INFO","msg":"threat intel feeds fetched","total_entries":1596}
{"level":"INFO","msg":"created Calico GlobalNetworkPolicy","name":"akash-guard-threatintel-egress-deny","entries":1596}
```

---

## Getting Started (building from source)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shimpa1/akash-guard.git
cd akash-guard
```

### 2. Configure your local build VM

```bash
cp local.mk.example local.mk
```

Edit `local.mk` and set `DEV_VM` to the IP or hostname of your Linux build VM:

```makefile
DEV_VM = 192.168.1.100
# DEV_USER = myuser   # optional, defaults to $USER
```

`local.mk` is gitignored — it is never committed.

### 3. Generate eBPF Go bindings

Compiles `bpf/tc_egress.c` into BPF bytecode and generates the Go bindings on the build VM over SSH, then pulls the results back. Run once, and again whenever `tc_egress.c` changes.

```bash
make generate
```

### 4. Build the binary

Cross-compiles a `linux/amd64` binary locally using Go's native cross-compilation. No VM needed after `generate`.

```bash
make build
# output: bin/akash-guard
```

### 5. Build and push the container image

The Docker build runs on the build VM (requires Docker installed there). The Dockerfile runs `go generate` internally, so the VM needs `clang`, `llvm`, `libbpf-dev`, and `gcc-multilib`.

```bash
make docker IMAGE=youruser/akash-guard TAG=v0.1.0
make push  IMAGE=youruser/akash-guard TAG=v0.1.0
```

---

## Configuration

`akash-guard` reads its configuration from a YAML file. The default path is `/etc/akash-guard/config.yaml`, overridable via the `AKASH_GUARD_CONFIG` environment variable.

Edit `deploy/configmap.yaml` for in-cluster deployments, or copy `config.yaml.example` for standalone use.

## Deployment

### 1. Apply RBAC

Creates a `ServiceAccount`, `ClusterRole`, and `ClusterRoleBinding` in `kube-system`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/rbac.yaml
```

The ClusterRole grants:
- `get/list/watch` on `nodes` and `pods` (for veth → namespace/pod resolution)
- `get/list/watch/create/update/patch/delete` on Calico `GlobalNetworkPolicy` CRDs

### 2. Configure and apply the ConfigMap

Edit `deploy/configmap.yaml` with your desired thresholds and alert destinations, then apply:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/configmap.yaml
```

### 3. Deploy the DaemonSet

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/daemonset.yaml
```

Verify pods are running on all nodes:

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l app=akash-guard
```

### 4. Check logs

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system logs -l app=akash-guard -f
```

Logs are structured JSON. Example threat intel policy creation:

```json
{"level":"INFO","msg":"threat intel feeds fetched","total_entries":1596}
{"level":"INFO","msg":"created Calico GlobalNetworkPolicy","name":"akash-guard-threatintel-egress-deny","entries":1596}
```

## Prometheus Metrics

`akash-guard` exposes metrics at `http://<node-ip>:9090/metrics`.

| Metric | Labels | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `akash_guard_alerts_total` | `type`, `namespace` | Counter incremented on every alert event |

Alert type values: `threat_intel_hit`, `high_pps`, `high_unique_dst_ips`, `port25_egress`, `high_syn_rate`.

A minimal Prometheus scrape config:

```yaml
- job_name: akash-guard
  kubernetes_sd_configs:
    - role: pod
  relabel_configs:
    - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app]
      action: keep
      regex: akash-guard
```

---

## Alert Event Schema

All channels (webhook, email, log) use the same JSON structure:

```json
{
  "time": "2026-04-12T10:23:45.123Z",
  "type": "high_pps",
  "namespace": "tenant-abc123-web",
  "pod_name": "web-deployment-6d4f8b-xk2pz",
  "dst_ip": "",
  "feed_source": "",
  "value": 14500,
  "threshold": 10000
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `type` | One of the alert type values listed above |
| `namespace` | Kubernetes namespace (maps to an Akash tenant deployment) |
| `pod_name` | Pod that triggered the alert, if resolved |
| `dst_ip` | Destination IP (threat intel hits only) |
| `feed_source` | Feed URL that matched (threat intel hits only) |
| `value` | Observed metric value that exceeded the threshold |
| `threshold` | Configured threshold that was breached |

---

## Verification

After deploying to a test provider, run through these checks:

**Threat Intel — policy creation**
```bash
kubectl get globalnetworkpolicy akash-guard-threatintel-egress-deny
kubectl get globalnetworkpolicy akash-guard-threatintel-egress-deny \
  -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations}'
```
Expected: policy exists, `akash-guard/entry-count` annotation shows ~1596 entries.

**Threat Intel — egress block**
```bash
# From inside a test pod, attempt to reach an IP on the Spamhaus DROP list.
# The connection should be dropped and a log line should appear:
kubectl -n kube-system logs -l app=akash-guard | grep threat_intel_hit
```

**High PPS / DDoS signal**
```bash
# From inside a test pod:
nmap -Pn --min-rate 3000 -p 1-3000 1.2.3.4
# Confirm high_pps alert fires in logs within one window period.
```

**Spam signal**
```bash
# From inside a test pod:
for i in $(seq 1 30); do nc -z -w1 1.2.3.4 25 & done
# Confirm port25_egress alert fires.
```

**Scan signal**
```bash
# From inside a test pod:
nmap -Pn -sS --min-rate 1000 1.2.3.0/24
# Confirm high_syn_rate and high_unique_dst_ips alerts fire.
```

**Whitelist**
```bash
# Add the namespace to the whitelist in deploy/configmap.yaml and redeploy.
# Generate the same traffic — confirm no alerts fire.
```

## Makefile Targets

| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `make generate` | Compile `tc_egress.c` → Go bindings on `DEV_VM` via SSH. Requires `DEV_VM` set in `local.mk`. |
| `make build` | Cross-compile `linux/amd64` binary to `bin/akash-guard`. No VM needed. |
| `make docker` | Build container image on `DEV_VM`. |
| `make push` | Push image from `DEV_VM` to registry. |
| `make clean` | Remove local build artefacts and remote temp directory. |
| `make all` | `generate` + `build`. |

Override variables on the command line:

```bash
make docker IMAGE=myregistry.io/akash-guard TAG=v0.2.0
make generate DEV_USER=ubuntu
```

## Limitations and Known Issues

- **`kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=2`**: Akash provider nodes restrict BPF to root. The DaemonSet must run as uid 0 with `privileged: true`. The published image uses the distroless root variant.
- **`AttachTCX` requires kernel ≥ 6.6**: If the provider node runs an older kernel, TC hook attachment will fail. Legacy `tc filter` attachment can be substituted in `loader.go`.
- **IPv4 only**: The eBPF hook currently tracks IPv4 egress only. IPv6 support is planned.
- **veth resolution**: Namespace/pod name resolution is best-effort. If a pod's IP has not yet appeared in the k8s API when the veth is first seen, the interface is recorded as `unknown`. It will be resolved on the next 5-second watcher tick once the pod IP is available.
- **Threat intel feeds**: Spamhaus feeds may require a paid subscription for high-volume or commercial use. See their [terms of service](https://www.spamhaus.org/organization/dnsblusage/).
- **No automatic enforcement**: By design. Providers must act on alerts manually or integrate with their own automation.
